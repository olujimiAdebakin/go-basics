# Go Fundamentals Showcase

A foundational collection of Go scripts designed to demonstrate core language concepts. This repository serves as a practical guide to understanding variables, data types, operators, and handling user input in Go.

## ✨ Features

-   **Data Type Exploration**: Clear examples of Go's built-in types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, and composite types like arrays, slices, maps, and structs.
-   **Operator Demonstrations**: Hands-on examples of arithmetic operators, showcasing integer vs. floating-point division, modulus, and order of operations.
-   **Interactive Console I/O**: A script dedicated to capturing and parsing various forms of user input, from simple strings to numbers, and performing type conversions.
-   **Clean, Commented Code**: Each script is heavily commented to explain the purpose and functionality of every code block, making it easy to learn from.

### Installation

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    -   Ensure you have [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (version 1.18 or higher) installed on your system.

2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/olujimiAdebakin/go-basics.git
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd go-basics
    ```

## Usage

Each Go file in this repository is a standalone program that can be run directly from your terminal.

#### 1. Variable and Data Type Examples

This script prints demonstrations of all major Go data types, from basic primitives to complex structures.

-   **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    go run var.go
    ```

-   **Expected Output:**
    The console will display the declaration and initialization of various data types, including strings, integers, floats, booleans, arrays, slices, maps, structs, and pointers.

#### 2. Operator Examples

This script demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and highlights key concepts like type casting and integer division.

-   **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    go run operator.go
    ```

-   **Expected Output:**
    The console will show the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations, along with examples of order of operations.

#### 3. User Input and Type Conversion Examples

This interactive script prompts the user for various inputs and demonstrates how to handle and convert them.

-   **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    go run type.go
    ```

-   **Expected Output:**
    The program will ask you for your name, birth year, height, and other details, then process and display the input.
    ```
    🚀 Program starting...
    📝 Please enter your name: John Doe
    👋 Hello, John Doe!
    🎂 Type your birth year (e.g., 1990): 1998
    🎉 You will be 27 years old at the end of 2025
    ...and so on for other inputs
    ```
