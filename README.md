# Go Fundamentals: A Practical Guide

This repository is a curated collection of standalone Go programs, each designed to demonstrate a core concept of the Go programming language. It serves as a practical, hands-on guide for beginners getting started with Go or developers looking for a quick refresher on its fundamental syntax and features.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Comprehensive Data Types**: Clear examples of strings, integers, floats, booleans, and complex types in `var.go`.
-   **Core Operators**: Demonstrations of arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators in `operator.go`.
-   **Control Flow Mastery**: In-depth exploration of `if-else`, `else-if`, and nested conditions in `conditions.go`.
-   **Advanced Looping**: Covers everything from basic `for` loops to `range`, `while`-style patterns, and nested loops in `loop.go`.
-   **Versatile Switch Statements**: Examples of basic switches, fallthrough, type switches, and expression-less switches in `switch.go`.
-   **User Input & Type Conversion**: Practical examples of reading user input and safely converting it between types in `type.go`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

| Technology | Description                            |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **Go**     | The core programming language used.    |
| **Git**    | Version control for managing the code. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the [Go compiler](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed on your local machine. You can verify your installation by running:

```bash
go version
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    Navigate to your desired directory and clone this repository using Git.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/olujimiAdebakin/go-basics.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd go-basics
    ```

## üìã Usage

Each `.go` file in this repository is a self-contained, executable program that demonstrates a specific concept. You can run any file individually using the `go run` command.

-   **To explore variables and data types**:
    ```bash
    go run var.go
    ```

-   **To understand operators**:
    ```bash
    go run operator.go
    ```

-   **To see conditional statements in action**:
    ```bash
    go run conditions.go
    ```

-   **To learn about different loop structures**:
    ```bash
    go run loop.go
    ```

-   **To experiment with switch statements**:
    ```bash
    go run switch.go
    ```

-   **To practice user input and type conversion**:
    ```bash
    go run type.go
    ```

Each file contains extensive comments explaining the code, and a commented-out section at the bottom shows the expected output.
