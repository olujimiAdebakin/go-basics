# Go Fundamentals Playground

A curated collection of Go scripts designed to provide a hands-on introduction to the core concepts of the Go programming language. This repository serves as a practical guide for anyone looking to build a solid foundation in Go, covering everything from variables and data types to control flow and user input.

## Features

-   **Data Types Deep Dive**: Explore Go's rich type system, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, arrays, slices, maps, and structs.
-   **Operators Explained**: Hands-on examples of arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators to build foundational logic.
-   **Control Flow Mastery**: Clear demonstrations of conditional logic using `if`, `else-if`, and `else` statements.
-   **Interactive I/O**: Learn how to handle user input from the command line and perform essential type conversions.

Each `.go` file in this repository is a standalone program designed to demonstrate a specific concept. You can execute them individually from your terminal to see the output and understand the code's behavior.

The code is heavily commented to serve as a learning guide.

-   **To explore data types and variables:**
    ```bash
    go run var.go
    ```

-   **To understand arithmetic operators:**
    ```bash
    go run operator.go
    ```

-   **To learn about conditional statements:**
    ```bash
    go run conditions.go
    ```

-   **To see examples of user input and type conversion:**
    ```bash
    go run type.go
    ```
