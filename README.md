# Go Core Concepts: A Practical Guide üêò

A comprehensive repository demonstrating the fundamental concepts of the Go programming language. This project serves as a hands-on guide, with each file dedicated to a specific feature, from basic data structures to advanced concurrency patterns. It's designed to be a clear and practical resource for both beginners and experienced developers looking to solidify their understanding of Go.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Core Data Structures**: In-depth examples for Arrays, Slices, and Maps.
-   **Control Flow**: Clear demonstrations of Loops, Conditions, and Switch statements.
-   **Functions & Methods**: Covers everything from basic functions and variadic parameters to closures and methods on structs.
-   **Types & Interfaces**: Practical examples of Go's type system, including structs, pointers, and the power of interfaces for polymorphism.
-   **Concurrency**: A deep dive into Goroutines and Channels, showcasing worker pools, select statements, and common concurrency patterns.
-   **Memory Management**: Explanations of `defer`, pointers, and the immutability of certain types.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

| Technology | Description                            |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------- |

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/olujimiAdebakin/go-basics.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd go-basics
    ```
3.  **Ensure you have Go installed**:
    You can download it from the [official Go website](https://go.dev/doc/install).

## üí° Usage

Each `.go` file in this repository is a self-contained program that can be run individually to explore a specific concept.

To run any of the files, use the `go run` command followed by the filename:

```bash
go run <filename>.go
```

For example, to run the demonstration on slices:
```bash
go run slice.go
```
