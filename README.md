This repository serves as a hands-on collection of simple yet comprehensive Go programs, demonstrating the fundamental building blocks of the language. It's designed for beginners starting their journey with Go or developers looking for a quick reference on core concepts.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Variables & Data Types:** Comprehensive examples of Go's type system, from basic integers and strings to complex types like slices, maps, and structs (`var.go`).
-   **Operators:** Clear demonstrations of arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators (`operator.go`).
-   **Control Flow:** Practical use cases for `if-else` statements, nested conditions, and logical branching (`conditions.go`).
-   **Looping Constructs:** A deep dive into Go's powerful `for` loop, covering various patterns from basic iteration to `while`-style loops and ranging over collections (`loop.go`).
-   **User Input & Type Conversion:** Interactive examples showing how to read user input from the console and safely convert it between different data types (`type.go`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Installation

Follow these steps to get the project set up on your local machine.

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    -   Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.18 or higher) installed on your system.

2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/olujimiAdebakin/go-basics.git
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd go-basics
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

Each `.go` file in this repository is a standalone, runnable program designed to demonstrate a specific concept. You can run any of them using the `go run` command.

Here‚Äôs how to execute each file and what you'll learn:

-   **Variables and Data Types**
    *   Explore Go's rich type system, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, arrays, slices, maps, and more.
    ```bash
    go run var.go
    ```

-   **Operators**
    *   See arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators in action.
    ```bash
    go run operator.go
    ```

-   **Conditional Statements**
    *   Understand how to control your program's flow with `if`, `else if`, and `else`.
    ```bash
    go run conditions.go
    ```

-   **Loops**
    *   Master iteration with Go's versatile `for` loop, including `while`-style and infinite loops.
    ```bash
    go run loop.go
    ```

-   **Type Conversion and User Input**
    *   Run an interactive program that takes user input and demonstrates type casting.
    ```bash
    go run type.go
    ```
