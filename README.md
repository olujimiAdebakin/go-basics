# Go Core Concepts Showcase

A foundational Go project designed to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the language's core data types, variable declarations, and type conversion mechanisms. This repository serves as a practical, hands-on guide to the building blocks of Go programming.

## Features

-   **Comprehensive Data Type Examples**: Demonstrates the declaration and usage of all fundamental Go data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, arrays, slices, maps, and structs.
-   **Interactive Type Conversion**: An interactive console program (`type.go`) that takes user input and performs real-time string-to-integer conversion.
-   **Clear Variable Demonstrations**: Showcases various patterns for variable declaration, initialization, zero values, and type inference.
-   **Memory Management Insights**: Includes examples of pointers to explain memory address concepts in Go.

## Technologies Used

| [**Go**](https://go.dev/) | An open-source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. |

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Go (version 1.18 or higher) installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://go.dev/dl/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-core-concepts-showcase.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Directory**
    ```bash
    cd go-core-concepts-showcase
    ```

## Usage

This project contains two separate, runnable programs. You can execute them directly from your terminal.

### 1. Exploring Go Data Types

The `var.go` file contains a detailed showcase of Go's data types. Running it will print a series of declarations and their resulting values to the console, serving as a complete reference.

**To run the script:**

```bash
go run var.go
```

**Expected Output:**

The program will print a structured output demonstrating each data type, from basic strings and integers to complex types like maps and structs.

```
Name: Bull
Number: 4000
Age: 25
...
Employee Struct: {1 Jane Doe 50000}
...
Hello, World! - All examples completed!
```

### 2. Interactive Type Conversion

The `type.go` file runs a small interactive program that prompts the user for input and demonstrates type conversion.

**To run the script:**

```bash
go run type.go
```

**Example Interaction:**

The program will first ask for any text input and then for your year of birth to calculate your future age.

```
Program starting...
Please enter some input: 
hello world
You entered: "hello world"
Type your DOB: 
1998
You will be 27 years old at the end of 2025:Program completed!
```
