# Go Fundamentals: A Practical Showcase

This repository serves as a comprehensive and hands-on guide to the core concepts of the Go programming language. Each file is a self-contained module that explores a specific feature, complete with detailed comments and practical examples. It is designed to be a learning resource for new Go developers and a demonstration of clean, idiomatic Go code.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Variables & Data Types**: In-depth exploration of Go's type system, from basic types (`var.go`) to type conversion and user input (`type.go`).
*   **Operators**: A clear breakdown of arithmetic and logical operators (`operator.go`).
*   **Control Flow**: Detailed examples of conditional logic with `if/else` (`conditions.go`) and advanced `switch` statements (`switch.go`).
*   **Looping Constructs**: Mastery of Go's sole looping keyword, `for`, demonstrating traditional loops, `while`-style loops, and iterating with `range` (`loop.go`, `range.go`).
*   **Core Data Structures**: Practical implementation of fixed-size `arrays` (`array.go`) and powerful, dynamic `slices` (`slice.go`).

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/olujimiAdebakin/go-basics.git
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd go-basics
    ```

## üìã Usage

Each `.go` file in this repository is an executable program designed to demonstrate a specific concept. You can run any file individually to see its output and understand its functionality.

To run a specific file, use the `go run` command followed by the filename.

**Example 1: Running the array demonstration**

```bash
go run array.go
```
This will execute the code in `array.go` and print a detailed demonstration of array declaration, modification, and iteration to your console.

**Example 2: Exploring loops**

```bash
go run loop.go
```
This command runs the `loop.go` file, showcasing various loop patterns including `for` loops, `while`-style loops, and iterating over data structures.

Feel free to explore any file in the repository using the same method. The code is heavily commented to explain what's happening at every step.
